## Getting Started

This repository requires Python >= 3.12. If you don't have it, download it at 
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)'s official website.

Clone the repository using:  
```
git clone https://github.com/a22Dv/cses-local.git`
```
Then use pipx to install the program. If you don't have pipx, you can install
it in your global environment by running:
```
pip install pipx
```
Then run:

```
pipx install .
```

Once pipx returns a confirmation, run
```
